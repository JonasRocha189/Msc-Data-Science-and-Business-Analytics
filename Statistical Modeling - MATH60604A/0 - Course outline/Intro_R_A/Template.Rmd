## R Markdown

We can write things up easily in RMarkdown.

We can also easily use some mathematical notations such as $Y$, $X_1$, $\beta_2$, $\sigma$, $\mu$. We can write equations, e.g.,
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$
We can also include R code:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

There are different options when incorporating chunks of R code, e.g. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```
