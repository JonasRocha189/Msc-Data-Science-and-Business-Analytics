# MATH60604A.A2025 - Statistical Modelling

## Description
The objective of this course is to provide students with the basics of statistical inference, as well as statistical tools for data modeling in a regression framework. The theory behind the statistical models will be reviewed with an emphasis on data applications in management.

The course will focus on regression models, including linear models, generalized linear models and models for longitudinal data with random effects and correlation structures. For each of these models, basic inference principles will be covered, notably hypothesis testing and estimation procedures.


## Themes
Basic principles in inference and statistical modeling
Linear models
Generalized linear models
Models for longitudinal data and correlated data
Introduction to survival analysis



## Objectives
At the end of the course, the student will be able to:

- understand the fundamental and theoretical notions of statistical inference as well as the foundations of modeling methods used in data science.
- use these methods in practice with relevant statistical software.
- position these statistical methods in the field of data science.
