##Introduction to R
R Sweave documents are a combination of R and \LaTeX{} codes that allow to produce neat reports. For instance:
```{r hist}
set.seed(1234567)
x=rnorm(30)
hist(x,col="gray",main="Histogram of random data")
box()
```

\section{Tables}
Some tricks may help improve the apperance of the output:
```{r table}
set.seed(1234567)
u=sample(0:1,50,replace=TRUE)
v=sample(0:1,50,replace=TRUE)
table(u,v)
```
The \tt{kable} function from \tt{knitr} for instance:

```{r bettertable}
require(knitr)
kable(table(u,v))
```


\section{Your turn}
Try to compile this file first. Then try to modify it and see if you can generate pdf reports automatically. There is a ton of online examples and support on how to tune your documents.
